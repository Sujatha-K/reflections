When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When more than 1 person wants to work or collaborate on a project, it is best to use a remote repository which is accessible to everyone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If pulling changes happens automatically then e=we may come across codes with incomplete features or codes that cannot be run.
