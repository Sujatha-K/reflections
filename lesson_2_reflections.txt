What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repo the .git hidden file is added to the directory. Only after doing this we will be able to commit and track our commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the deciding ground for a file. The file can either go back to the working directory or to the repo from here.
